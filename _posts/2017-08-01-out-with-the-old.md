## Site Update

This is my personal home page's first major overall since I set it up in October of 2012.

Back then, I made my header images 680x260. Now I'm remaking them all for full-width 4k displays at 3840x800. In 2012 I stitched the various elements of my pages together with PHP, now we have tools such as Jekyll and continuous integration builds meaning I can update the site with a simple git push.
