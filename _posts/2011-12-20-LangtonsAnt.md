> Cellular Automata in ROOT

It's possible to set up an interactive, updating canvas in ROOT via use of `TApplication`, here some patterns generated by an implementation of [Langton's Ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant) are shown. Possibly my favourite cellular automaton, Langton's ant follows the simplest of rules:

 * On white: turn to coloured, rotate $$\pi/2$$ clockwise, move forward.
 * On coloured: turn to white, rotate $$\pi/2$$ counter-clockwise, move forward.

After an apparent chaotic period, the automaton starts producing a long 'road' pattern. Here four ants interact with each other on a wrapping grid, leaving different coloured tiles but operating under the same rules (tiles are coloured, or white).

Extensions to the Ant's rules are typically called [termites](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Turmite.html). By adding an additional state to the ant, a spiral may be produced.

Or a golden rectangle, here using the rule set:

 * On white and state 0: set to state 1, turn to coloured, rotate $$\pi/2$$ counter-clockwise, move forward.
 * On white and state 1: turn to coloured, rotate $$\pi/2$$ clockwise, move forward.
 * On coloured and state 0: set to state 1, rotate $$\pi/2$$ counter-clockwise, move forward.
 * On coloured and state 1: set state to 0, turn to white, move forward.

Other variants include adding more coloured states and altering the direction of travel based on the colour of the square.
