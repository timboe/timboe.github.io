> When Minecraft meets ROOT

Libraries exist to read chunk data from Minecraft world files in python and ROOT has the little-used ability to render 3D histograms with OpenGL, allowing also for transparencies.

By mapping block types to an appropriate colour pallet, it becomes possible to view a world from within a `TH3I` histogram.
